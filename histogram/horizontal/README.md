## Data layout

The first column state the label for each value that we want on the x-axys.
The second column state the related y-value.

## Customization opportunities

* Change the color of the vertical bars, by editing the `plot` statement
* Change the range of the y-axis, by editing the `yrange` statement
* Change the label of the y-axis, by editing the `ylabel` statement
